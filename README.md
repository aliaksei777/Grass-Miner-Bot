🚀 <b>Welcome!</b><br>
I am GrassMinerBot — http://t.me/grass_miner_bot for https://www.getgrass.io/<br> 
Allow me to briefly explain my strengths:

✅ <b>Stability</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use dedicated servers and reliable resources that are exclusively allocated for your mining. No third-party processes interfere with my work.

✅ <b>Proxy</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I automatically obtain new proxies from real users in more than 240 countries worldwide.

✅ <b>Networks</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My networks offer an optimal cost — from 0.075 USDT per network per month (excluding discounts).

✅ <b>Traffic</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a fixed pricing model for traffic packages. You don’t need to load proxies manually — simply select the country you’re interested in. I work directly with three major international proxy providers and balance them automatically depending on the number of countries selected by users.

✅ <b>Referral System</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My referral system allows you to receive a 5% discount on traffic package purchases by inviting new users.

✅ <b>Promo-Codes</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My promo-code system lets you obtain discounts on networks and traffic packages — or even free mining days for your networks.

✅ <b>Efficiency</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully emulate the behavior of the Grass extension and also handle outgoing traffic using AI. For every 100 networks per day, approximately 50 megabytes of traffic is consumed, considering the consistently reliable performance of Grass servers.

✅ <b>Security</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I protect your data and never use your account’s login or password. I operate solely using your unique identifier in the Grass system.

✅ <b>Responsibility</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I launch all new processes in a queue order, but only from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM—primarily Monday through Friday — while my support team is online to assist you if needed.
